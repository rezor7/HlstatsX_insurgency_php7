# hlstatsx_insurgency
<h2>hlstatsx community edition files for use with insurgency - standalone</h2>
<br>
these files are created to use for game insurgency and to support the coop-mode <br>
No Bots are shown in the web-view, botkills are counted but bots are marked as invisible<br>
some extra awards are added and the option to mark some as negative such "most deaths, most tks and so on"<br>
Should all work really smooth, example can be viewed at www.daddelhaufen.de<br>
<br>
My work and changes is based of a lot of fine ppl:<br>
<br>
